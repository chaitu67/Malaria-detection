# Malaria-detection
image classification model that detects the presence of malaria
The following steps need to be followed to start the project.
-download the images from source(https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)
-save it on you loacal machine
-open the python file which is present.
-change the path in the program to the orginal path where you have saved the images
